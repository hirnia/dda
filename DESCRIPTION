Description: Functions to analyze the direction dependence of competing linear models
             (Wiedermann, W., & von Eye, A., 2015) <doi.org/10.1177/0165025415582056>
             notably building upon Dodge & Rousson's (2001) correlation coefficient 
             asymetry property framework <doi.org/10.1198/000313001300339932>.
             The package includes functions to calculate test independence, residual,
             and variable distribution property statistics for competing models that
             are conditioned upon different moderator levels. Plotting and summary generic 
             capabilities are also available for conditional models. For more information
             and code for SPSS implementation, see <https://www.ddaproject.com>.
